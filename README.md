### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Improve responsiveness across different screen sizes.  
- Practice using CSS variables more effectively.  
- Deepen my understanding of accessibility (proper use of `aria-*` attributes and color contrast).  
- Study best practices for organizing CSS (such as BEM and CSS architecture).
